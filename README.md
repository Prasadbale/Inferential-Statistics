# Inferential-Statistics


Welcome to the "Inferential Statistics for Data Science" repository! This repository is dedicated to providing resources and materials to help you learn and apply inferential statistics concepts in the field of data science. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data scientist, you will find valuable content here to enhance your understanding of statistical inference.


## Introduction

Inferential statistics is a crucial component of data science that allows us to make inferences and draw conclusions from data. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of resources, including PDF documents and Jupyter notebooks, to help you grasp the fundamentals of inferential statistics and apply them to real-world data analysis projects.
